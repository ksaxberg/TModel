This is a small collection of flight data, from Oct 17 to Oct 18, 2016. The site request 
included the full range from Oct 11 to Oct 19. This indicates a slight issue with data gathering,
or that no flights were flown from Oct 11 to Oct 16, and on Oct 19.
The airports of interest are listed in population.txt. This information was pulled from flightstats.

The information regarding number of passengers on flights came from the following site:
