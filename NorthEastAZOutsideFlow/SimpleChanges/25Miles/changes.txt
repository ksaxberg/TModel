##### Concerns about changes

In fabricating cities, assumptions may be made about how distance
affects travel predictions. Simply using a uniform distance for the
outside nodes may help, but if it is calibrated on how the additional
traffic data should be accounted for in the distance and population, 
we can start to see confirmational effects as new data "conforms" to 
how we expect the data to do in the model, thus showing improvement 
in the model as we have tailored data for the model.

##### Details of changes

Combined Eager and Springervile, though distinct cities they
are not geographically seperable.

For the Traffic Values leading to Holbrook, this may indicate 
visitors to the city, but may also indicate travel to the 
nearest large interstate highway. Roughly ~16000 traffic count
on either side of the city, adding this number to the population
of Holbrook as a representation of attractiveness of the interstate. 


Node: NodeOutsideSpringerville
    Added the traffic from US60: ~700 to the traffic from northbound US191 ~400
    Giving a population estimate of 5000 people. 
    Giving a distance of 50 miles.

Node: SouthShowlow
    Added the traffic from US60 ~ 2000 
    Giving a population estimate of 10000 people.
    Giving a distance of 50 miles.

Node: WestHeber
    Added the traffic from west part of Local 260: ~6000
    Giving a population estimate of 20000.
    Giving a distance of 50 miles.
