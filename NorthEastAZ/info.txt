The NorthEast AZ Data set:

This dataset is an attempt to look at model output on small cities that are 
reasonably isolated. The region chosen was a segment of cities in Arizona, 
with a bounding triangle including Holbrook on I40, Heber-Overgaard, and 
Springerville. Route distances were calculated with Google Maps, and the 
population sizes were collected from the Wikipedia article for each city. 

Road data values were collected off of the Arizona DOT site: 
http://www.azdot.gov/planning/DataandAnalysis

The values used were 2015 AADT's, using the bidirectional sum. On the path shown
by Google Maps, a rough average was taken of a near-midpoint between two cities
with consideration given to lower values along the path representing closer to
true "through" values on the road segment. 

This dataset represents no filtering or changes to the cities within, leading
to a questionable collection as we have several cities with distances of less
than 10 miles, meaning we are predicting commuter traffic in addition to the
distance traffic of interest.
