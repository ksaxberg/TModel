This dataset represents the annual passenger count exchange on Ferry boats in
the Caribbean. Two range values are also given, one representing maximum
potential flow values, and one representing a 50% confidence interval on each
port to port connection, the sum of which still provides a wide range of
potential values.

The passenger count value stems not from the "measured" value category,
but instead entirely from the estimated passenger count. The "measured" values
lie within the range of the estimated count, and so if the calibrated fit lies
within the newly expanded range, this should be a positive sign.

Population options are from the sum of port populations, or the population
of the entire country.

Note on results:
R^2 correlation is poor for all variations, the highest being around .32
