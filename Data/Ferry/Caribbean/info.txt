This dataset represents the annual passenger count exchange on Ferry boats in
the Caribbean. Two range values are also given, one representing maximum
potential flow values, and one representing a 50% confidence interval on each
port to port connection, the sum of which still provides a wide range of
potential values.


Population options are from the sum of port populations, or the population
of the entire country.
