This dataset represents a collection of air traffic for the first quarter 
of 2016. Several issues were encountered with managing this dataset, which
are detailed below. Population allocation remains an issue, and only a subset
of the dataset was able to be run through the model due to inability to 
automate the information retrieval, and due to the difficulty of calibration
on the subset of data already managed.

Air Carriers: T-100 Domestic Market (US Carriers)


Filtering out service class that isn't F or L, as those are the 
passenger service designations.


Did not have ability to resolve served area. Settled for hand picking the 
populations surrounding the airports. Using the metropolitan areas for those 
available, and attempted to go down the list based on frequency and size population
travelling through.
