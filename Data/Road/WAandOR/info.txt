This is a collection of AADT dataset for the cities in Oregan and Washington
whose population exceeds 50,000 people. This only included 6 cities in Oregon
and 8 cities in Washington. Populations were retrieved from Wikipedia, with the 
road data benchmarked off of the 2015 Oregan State Department of Transportation 
AADT dataset and the 2015 Washington State Department of Transportation AADT 
data.
