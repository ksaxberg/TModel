A set of calibrated data from Craig, representing population and 
human mobility in Arizona. This dataset contains only 9 nodes, some 
of which represent large cities and some represent clustering of
small cities or sparsely populated regions. The road segment data
was recovered from the 2015 Arizona Department of Transportation AADT
data, available as of January, 2017 at the following site.

Populations of various regions were collected from Metropolitan 
Statistical areas from the 2010 census, and various other listings for
the smaller city regions.
