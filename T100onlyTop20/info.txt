Dataset is a subset of the T100 collection
Goal:
    Attempt to analyze gravity assumption on a smaller subset of airports
Only 4 routes had to be edited (decremented by 1) to "fix" the graph

Results:
    Similarly terrible results to that of the 125 city dataset

Air Carriers: T-100 Domestic Market (US Carriers)


Filtering out service class that isn't F or L, as those are the 
passenger service designations.


Did not have ability to resolve served area. Settled for hand picking the 
populations surrounding the airports. Using the metropolitan areas for those 
available, and attempted to go down the list based on frequency and size population
travelling through.
